# Miiverse-Museum

This is a twitter bot, dedicated to showcasing random drawings from "Miiverse", a social media site for Nintendo 3DS/WiiU owners that has been discontinued since 2017.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This project would not have been possible without the work done by the [Archiverse team](https://archiverse.guide/), who archived a chunk of Miiverse prior to its closing. The images this bot will tweet come from their publically available [database backup](https://archive.org/details/archiverse).

The actual image archives are stored on the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).



## FAQ

### Q: "That's my art! Can I get credit?"
#### A: Absolutely. 
Ideally, I would have loved to give the artists showcased on this account updated credit, that links to their currently active accounts alongside the post. But unfortunately, given the age of the Miiverse posts, alongside the sheer volume of posts the bot is given, the only credit that could be given was the data associated with the post (username, date, community, etc.). But of course, if this info is provided to me, I would love to give updated credit alongside the post! If you created a work posted by this bot, or know who created a work posted by this bot, please DM the bot, ideally with verification, so that proper credit can be given.

Similarly, if you created a work, and want me to delete a post, or edit the credits given (like if, for example, the username provided includes your deadname), DM me the post, alongside verification that you are the artist, and I'd be more than willing to delete/edit the post, no questions asked.

### Q: "Can I suggest a post to be featured by the account?"
#### A: No, but only because I do not decide what the bot posts.
I applied some mild filtering to the Archiverse database (specifically, filtering out posts with less than 5 "Yeahs" to remove spammy posts), but outside of that the drawings posted are a completely random sample of posts. This method does not always result in the best content being showcased, but I believe that it's the best way of capturing what Miiverse was like, not just the platform at its best/worst.
