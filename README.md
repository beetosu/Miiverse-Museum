# Miiverse-Museum

This will be a twitter bot, dedicated to showcasing random drawings from "Miiverse", a social media site for Nintendo 3DS/WiiU owners that has been discontinued since 2017.
This project would not have been possible with out the work done by the [Archiverse team](https://archiverse.guide/), who archived a chunk of Miiverse prior to its closing. The images this bot will tweet come from their publically available [database backup](https://archive.org/details/archiverse).
The actual image archives are stored on the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).
